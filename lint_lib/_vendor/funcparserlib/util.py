def pretty_tree(x, kids, show):
    """Return a pseudo-graphic tree representation of the object `x` similar to the
    `tree` command in Unix.

    Type: `(T, Callable[[T], List[T]], Callable[[T], str]) -> str`

    It applies the parameter `show` (which is a function of type `(T) -> str`) to get a
    textual representation of the objects to show.

    It applies the parameter `kids` (which is a function of type `(T) -> List[T]`) to
    list the children of the object to show.

    Examples:

    ```pycon
    >>> print(pretty_tree(
    ...     ["foo", ["bar", "baz"], "quux"],
    ...     lambda obj: obj if isinstance(obj, list) else [],
    ...     lambda obj: "[]" if isinstance(obj, list) else str(obj),
    ... ))
    []
    |-- foo
    |-- []
    |   |-- bar
    |   `-- baz
    `-- quux

    ```
